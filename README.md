[Unraid on tailscale support page](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/90719-support-tailscale-support-thread/)


This is intentended to provide access to the unraid server itself over tailscale and does not act as a VPN gateway.
It is possible to get this working using UP_FLAGS however as this was never the intention for this container I cannot provide
support for this usage.

## Optional Env Vars

- `UP_FLAGS` &ndash; Pass flags to the `tailscale up` command run on start-up
Please note that support cannot be provided for the use of `UP_FLAGS`
- `DEAMON_FLAGS` &ndash; Pass flags to the `tailscaled` command run on start-up, for example to enable [Userspace Networking Mode](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/5425)
Please note that support cannot be provided for the use of `DEAMON_FLAGS`
